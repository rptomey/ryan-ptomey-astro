		<h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Hi, I'm Ryan Ptomey.</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Kansas City, MO. If you're not from the Midwest and you've heard of KC, you likely either know it as flyover territory or one of 4 acceptable styles of BBQ. I've spent most of my life in KCMO, and I'm kind of a fan. Outside of general travel, I also spent a couple years in Chicago for undergrad, so I picked up a few food opinions there, too.

            I graduated from college in May of 2009. That year was the height of the Great Recession (the worst economic downturn since the 1930s). I entered that scary, hopeless job market with a BA in English (if only I'd seen Avenue Q years earlier). Fortunately, I found a home working for a boss who was also an English major, and she was kind enough to bring me in and show me the ropes at a now defunct online advertising agency.

            After several years of flirting with digital analytics, I eventually managed to work my way into a full-time position at the analytics agency I work for now. While I started out working in both Tableau and Google Tag Manager, I discovered that the latter scratched an itch I didn't know I had. Since focusing my efforts on web analytics implementation work for our clients, I've found myself constantly challenged - in a good way!

            When you embrace implementation work, every new project is like a puzzle, and every client interaction can become a way of helping someone achieve their goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value the open sharing of knowledge and the pursuit of becoming a well-rounded person, and I recognize how many other people have helped me get to where I am today. Because of these values and realizations, I've started this website to help you learn more about Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and other tools to make your work better.
